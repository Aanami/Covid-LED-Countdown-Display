# Covid-LED-Countdown-Display
Using the Neopixel display (LED array) I created a countdown mechanism displaying the time for washing hands which was placed behind a 2 way mirror and used the flow sensor to detect the opening or closing of the tap.  Hardware included arduino, Ac 230V to DC 5V converter, 2812B LED Array.
